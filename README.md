# Quick Start: Borrowing Assets from the Compound Protocol

Examples for borrowing Ethereum assets from the [Compound Protocol](https://compound.finance/?ref=github&user=ajb413&repo=compound-borrow-examples).

**[Full Quick Start Tutorial on the Compound Medium Blog](https://medium.com/compound-finance/borrowing-assets-from-compound-quick-start-guide-f5e69af4b8f4)** 

If you want to borrow assets directly from the protocol from your Ethereum wallet using JSON RPC and Web3.js, see the `web3-js-examples` folder. JSON RPC can be utilized in the **web browser or with Node.js**.

If you want to borrow assets from the protocol from your Ethereum smart contract, see the `solidity-examples` folder.

## What is Compound?
Compound is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system. Learn more on the website:

</a>

## Setup
The code in this repository can be used to borrow assets from Compound on the Ethereum mainnet, any public test net, or your own localhost with [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

If you haven't already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS. Clone this repository, `cd` to the root directory of the project, and run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:compound-developers/compound-borrow-examples.git
cd compound-borrow-examples/
npm install
```

We'll need `npx` for this project. If you don't have `npx`, install it using this command:
```bash
npm install -g npx
```

If you want to use the script examples in the **web browser**, you'll need to first import web3.js in your HTML file using the following line. You'll also need to import the JS example files into your HTML. This step is **not necessary** if you are running the examples with only Node.js.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web3@1.2.6/dist/web3.min.js"></script>
```

### Running a Local Ethereum Test Net with Ganache CLI
To get the localhost test net running, use the following commands in a second command line window. The command runs Ganache CLI and forks the Main Ethereum network to your machine.

**If you are not running your own Ethereum node, make an [Infura](https://infura.io/) account at [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/).** Accounts are free. Get a **project ID** and supplant it into the terminal command below.

```bash
cd compound-borrow-examples/

## Run a fork of Mainnet locally using Ganache CLI
npx ganache-cli \
  -f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR INFURA API KEY HERE> \
  -m "clutch captain shoe salt awake harvest setup primary inmate ugly among become" \
  -i 1 \
  -u 0x9759A6Ac90977b93B58547b4A71c78317f391A28
```

- `-f` Forks the Main Ethereum network to your local machine for development and testing.
- `-m` Runs Ganache with an Ethereum key set based on the mnemonic passed. The first 10 addresses have 100 test ETH in their balance on the local test net every time you boot Ganache. **Do not use this mnemonic anywhere other than your localhost test net.**
- `-i` Sets an explicit network ID to avoid confusion and errors.
- `-u` Unlocks an address so you can write to your localhost test blockchain without knowing that address's private key. We are unlocking the above address so we can mint our own test DAI on our localhost test net. The address for minting DAI changes occasionally (see **Minting Localhost Test DAI** section below for updating).

## Borrowing Assets Directly via Web3 JSON RPC
These code examples can be run by a web browser or with Node.js. If you want to use a web browser, you'll need to import the web3.js script in your HTML or JS file (see import above).

Running these scripts will give your wallet borrowed **ETH** and **Dai**. cTokens are ERC20 Tokens that can be **used to redeem an ever-increasing amount of the underlying asset**. The cToken exchange rate **increases every Ethereum block**, they can be transferred, and can be used to redeem at any time, as long as the underlying collateral does not support an open borrow.

### Localhost Test Net
- Run your local testnet in a second command line window **using the command above**.
- If supplying Dai (an ERC20 token example) as collateral, you need to **first** seed some in your wallet using `node seed-account-with-erc20/dai.js`. You may need to update the Dai mainnet contract address and the `MCD_JOIN_DAI` address in the script. This changes periodically as Dai is improved (see **Minting Localhost Test DAI** section below for updating).
- `cd web3-js-examples/`
- `node borrow-erc20-with-eth-collateral.js` To borrow Dai with ETH collateral.
- `node borrow-eth-with-erc20-collateral.js` To borrow ETH with Dai collateral.

### Public Test Net or Main Net
- Make sure you have a wallet with ETH for the Ethereum network you plan to interface with (Main, Ropsten, Kovan, etc.).
- Insert the private key of your wallet in the scripts where noted. It's a best practice to insert the private key using an environment variable instead of revealing it in the code with a string literal.
- Replace the HTTP provider in the `web3` constructors in the JS scripts in `web3-js-examples/`. Replace it using the string provided by the "Endpoint" selector in your Infura project dashboard. The localhost test net provider is `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.
- Next, replace the contract addresses in the JSON file with the most recent ones. You can find Compound's cToken contract addresses for each network on this page: [https://compound.finance/docs#networks](https://compound.finance/docs#networks). The DAI contract address can be found in the Maker DAO website change logs [https://changelog.makerdao.com/](https://changelog.makerdao.com/).

## Minting Localhost Test DAI
To mint some DAI for your localhost test network, you must use the **Join DAI** address. This can be unlocked when running Ganache CLI. You'll need to update the Join DAI address and the contract address each time the DAI contracts are updated. 

The contract address can be found at [https://changelog.makerdao.com/](https://changelog.makerdao.com/).

- Click the latest production release.
- Click contract addresses.
- The Mainnet DAI contract address is in the JSON value of the `MCD_DAI` key.
- The Join DAI address is in the `MCD_JOIN_DAI` key.

Once you're certain you have the latest DAI and Join DAI address:

- Run Ganache CLI using the command above with `-u` and the Join DAI address.
- Paste the new addresses in `node seed-account-with-erc20/dai.js` and save.
- Run `node seed-account-with-erc20/dai.js`
- See the other scripts in the `seed-account-with-erc20` folder and the addresses to unlock in order to seed the wallet with other supported ERC-20s.
